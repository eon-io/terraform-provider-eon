## Example Usage

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    eon = {
      source = "eon-io/eon"
    }
  }
}

provider "eon" {
  endpoint       = var.eon_endpoint
  client_id      = var.eon_client_id
  client_secret  = var.eon_client_secret
  project_id     = var.eon_project_id
  eon_account_id = var.eon_account_id
}
```

## Authentication

The provider supports authentication via OAuth2 client credentials. You can configure authentication in several ways:

### Environment Variables

```bash
export EON_ENDPOINT="https://<your-domain>.console.eon.io"
export EON_CLIENT_ID="your-client-id"
export EON_CLIENT_SECRET="your-client-secret"

export EON_ACCOUNT_ID="your-account-id"
```

### Provider Configuration

provider "eon" {
  endpoint       = "https://<your-domain>.console.eon.io"
  client_id      = "your-client-id"
  client_secret  = "your-client-secret"
  project_id     = "your-project-id"
