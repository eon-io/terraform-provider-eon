```terraform
# Example: Connect an AWS source account for backup operations
resource "eon_source_account" "aws_production" {
  name                = "Production AWS Account"
  cloud_provider      = "AWS"
  provider_account_id = "123456789012"
  role                = "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/EonBackupRole"
